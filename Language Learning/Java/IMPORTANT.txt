After installing jdk 23 and exporting the path on .rcbash when can now compile and execute java files


For compiling files we need the file to have a class with the same name(?)
        if we have a test.java with main in a class called somthing else like "Main" we get
                test.java:1: error: class Main is public, should be declared in a file named Main.java
                public class Main{
                       ^
                1 error

        we use 
                javac fname.java
        to compile and we use 
                java fname.java 
        to run the file
        
TO CREATE AND USE A NEW PACKAGE:
        First we need a main java file to add this line:
                
                "javac -d . fname.java "

                javac compila; -d . in the same directory; what is written in fname.java;

                fname.java contains 
                
                this compiles the project and creates a directory especified in the with the package syntax
                


                package myClass;  this creates in the same directory of the script a folder myClass with fnama.class 

                public class Main{
                (...)
                }

                Program.java
                Program.class
                myClass/
                        Program.class 


        Then we run it telling java the full path of the program.class like:
                
                java tools.toolkit.Program
