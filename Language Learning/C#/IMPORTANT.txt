C#  -   A statically strongly and safe typed compiled programming language. 
        Known for being the language used by the .net framwork. 

Compile and run simple app:

        csc script.cs
        mono script.exe
   Source: https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/


                First you complie with script.cs, then you execute the executable created wih mono script.exe


Creating an app (not the way I wanted, but i had to give up for now):
        
        First we need to install a tool to build our programs. We are going to use the .NET SDK 
        to build and run whatever we build for now.
                
                Command to install: sudo apt install -y  dotnet-skd-8.0 (or the newest version available)

        Second we use the .NET to build a skeleton for our program with a Main functions(because i dont know how to make the lsp work with a .cs file from scratch):
                
                Command to create skeleton: 
                        dotnet new console -n "filename" --use-program-main
                
        Now we can use the run command on the program directory to run the file:
                
                Command to run: dotnet run
                You can run this commmand with the opt --no-build after the first run, 
                to make it quicker

Adding a Class lib:
        
        for now i only know how to create one library folder contains one class file.

                we are gonna run the command:
                        dotnet new classlib -n ClassName
