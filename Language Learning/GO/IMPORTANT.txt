Used :Lspinstall go to instal dependencies for autocomplete go

The instructions on the GOlang website work, but they were reseting after closing the terminal, so I echoed the second comand to the .bashrc. Now it works on boot

To create a project we're gonna use:
        go mod tidy
                to create a go.mod file so we can run our script 

        go mod init example.com/m/v2
                I still dont know why i would use this module

running is easy just "go run fname.go" or "go run ." but only when you have one *.go file

GO seems to 
        -not let you get input without error handling
        -use := when declaring a new variable with a value defining the type
        -use = when assigning to an existing variable with a type already defined
