C#  -   A statically strongly and safe typed compiled programming language. 
        Known for being the language used by the .net framwork. 


Creating an app (not the way I wanted, but i had to give up for now):
        
        First we need to install a tool to build our programs. We are going to use the .NET SDK 
        to build and run whatever we build for now.
                
                Command to install: sudo apt install -y  dotnet-skd-8.0 (or the newest version available)

        Second we use the .NET to build a skeleton for our program (because i dont know how to 
        compile a c# file from scratch):
                
                Command to create skeleton: dotnet new console -n "filename"
                
        Now we can use the run command on the program directory to run the file:
                
                Command to run: dotnet run
                You can run this commmand with the opt --no-build after the first run, 
                to make it quicker
